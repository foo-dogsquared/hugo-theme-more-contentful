This will add https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started[Twitter cards] for your webpages.
(Be sure to copy the `head` partial first in your own layout folder.)

Thankfully, Hugo already has https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#twitter-cards[an internal template for Twitter cards].
Simply add  `{{- template "_internal/twitter_cards.html" . -}}` somewhere in your own copy.
(For reference, https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/25a6b33693992e8c6d9c35bc1e781ce3e2bca4be/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/twitter_cards.html[here's the source code for the internal template].)

You could also roll your own Twitter cards but I recommend to modify the internal template instead fitting your specific needs.
(Copy the internal template from the given link, create it as a partial in `layouts/partials/twitter_cards.html`, modify it, and insert the template with `{{- partial "twitter_cards.html" -}}`.)
