Next up, we're implementing https://opengraphprotocol.org/[Open Graph protocol] for our webpages.
Commonly used for making suitable format when sharing the content on certain sites like Facebook.
(Be sure to copy the `head` partial first in your own layout folder.)

Similar to Twitter cards, Hugo has https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#open-graph[an internal template for this].
Simply add  `{{- template "_internal/opengraph.html" . -}}` somewhere in your own copy.
(For reference, https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/25a6b33693992e8c6d9c35bc1e781ce3e2bca4be/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/opengraph.html[here's the source code for the internal template].)

If you want more control and customized version of the output, I recommend to copy the internal template and create a partial (e.g., `layouts/partials/opengraph.html`) and modify it.
